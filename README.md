Problem Statement:

People who are blind have difficulties moving around, reading text, and recognizing objects.
White canes and assistive technologies to detect proximities are available on the market, but they don't help in identifying the object.
1.4 million blind children in the world. At least 200,000 children in India have severe visual impairment or blindness. 
People who are blind can read only Braille text and Braille is not available everywhere they go.

Solution:

This project is an object recognition, text recognition, proximity detection and fall detection system to aid the visually impaired people.
